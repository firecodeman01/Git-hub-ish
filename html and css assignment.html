	<h1>Drumming</h1>
	<p >I love drumming. Alot of people like to believe that the lead singer or front man of a particular group is the key ingredient to a successful musician however, this is not true. Imagine all the rap songs without beats or all of the rock songs without drums or someone to steadily carry everyone to the end. That would be the most bland music ever produced. Sometimes people do not want to agree with this idea, to that I say <b>"talk to the hand"</b></p>

	<h1>Learning about new things</h1>
	<p>I always take every opportunity to learn something new. I used to not want to because I was very shy. Though I am still shy, I have learned to try and get out of my comfort zone because that is where the most learning takes place.</p>
